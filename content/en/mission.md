Our purpose is to revive the ideals of the first Pilgrim Reformers of America who, with the spirit of the Protestant reformation, sought to purify and reform the faith. With this we seek to return our denomination, the United Church of Christ, to orthodoxy through affirming the traditional reformed faith and embracing traditional Christian values.  We ask that theologically conservative members of the UCC join us in taking a stance against the liberalism that has allowed secular culture to infiltrate the church and to restore our denomination to its reformed roots from which it has strayed. We also call our members to take an active role in affirming the relevance of the fundamental creeds of Christianity, the Nicene, Apostlesâ€™, and Athanasian Creeds as well as the singing and praying of psalms to better understand the truths of Holy Scripture. With the support of other like-minded Christians, in coordination with the Protestant Reconquista, we embrace *Semper Reformanda* with the revival of the Puritan aspiration to make the church a city on a hill.
