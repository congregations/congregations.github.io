Congregationalist and Uniting churches declare unity with the historic Christian community from the grass-roots baseline. Our communities have individual statements of faith positioning them within the network of theology and ecclesiology within the total Protestant heritage, demonstrating the unity of the Christian witness and the immediate personal character of true faith in Christ.

## Semper Reformanda

This webpage represents participants in the [Protestant Reconquista](https://www.operationreconquista.com/) movement who attend Congregationalist or Uniting churches – chiefly the [United Church of Christ](https://www.ucc.org/) and the [United Church of Canada](https://united-church.ca/). We want to preserve the witness of biblically orthodox faith in an environment where non-Trinitarian beliefs, deism, universalism, and sexual revolution are common. We hope to provide opportunities to meet likeminded believers and to form meaningful connections with local churches and ministries to anyone interested in our mission.

## 95 Theses

There was an activism campaign organized for Reformation Day this year, for which documents patterned after Martin Luther’s original 95 Theses were written to each of the major U.S. mainline Protestant denominations.

You can [download](ucc-theses-2023.pdf) the 95 Theses to the modern U.C.C.
